MOSViz is a quick-look analysis and visualization tool for multi-object
spectroscopy (MOS). It is designed to work with pipeline output: spectra
and associated images, or just with spectra. MOSViz is created to work with
data from any telescope/instrument, but is built with the micro-shutter array
(MSA) on the JWST/NIRSpec spectrograph in mind. As such,
MOSViz has some features specific to NIRSpec data.

You can read the full specification at `the online documentation <http://mosviz.readthedocs.io/>`_.
